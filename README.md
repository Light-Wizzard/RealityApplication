# Reality Application

AR VR Reality for Web, Desktop, Mobile, and beyond

The goal of this Repository is develope one application that will work in multiple Realities.

I will design a Viritual Reality or VR headset and controllers, as a Do it Yourself or DIY project, with all the planes, and even some links to equipment that can test the optical systems this project has designed, such as 
[Radiant Vision Systems](https://www.radiantvisionsystems.com/products/imaging-colorimeters-photometers/ar/vr-lens), 
as well as others, so you can ensure the design you will use is tested.

The optical system I will be using is per eye monitor, so you will have a lens, this can be glass or plastic, without or witout a perscription, but I will make sure you can order these lens from any opical glass manufacture, or your eye doctor, I will make sure these are the same sizes as those for other gear, like the Quest system, or more expensive units.

My Goal is to design a wrap around glass, these have a band that go around your head, and tighten in the back, it has an optional strap that goes over your head, and another optoinal helment you put on, this is used for motorcycles, and uses an approved helment for legal use in any state, these will come in AR or Agumented Reality, where you can see through the glasses into your reality, and see well enough to legally drive on any highway, the interaction in drive mode, is to show you all your instruments on a Heads Up Display or HUD, you see your fuel level, and time till empty, and your speed, as well as the speed limit, and will show you in read when you go over that.

The software can be upgraded to include the manual for the vechel your driving, so it can show you how to troubleshoot, and fix things that can go wrong, and tell you when to call a tow truck, and even make that call for you, but you still have to talk to them, but it can pull up informaton about where you are, making it easier for them to find you.

I will use Qt as well as .Net MAUI, to write the same app, to show you how you can write the same app using a different framework, to achieve the same thing.

VR Gear is not required to follow this project, the gear created here is purly experimental, and I do not have the money to actually buy the parts and the test equipment to test this design, but that is how a lot of projects get started, I will use off the shelf parts, that have well known specs, and is suitable for the use of VR or AR, keep in mind these two technologies require different applications.

My goal is to show you in code how to write for both AR and VR while being compatible with Reality, and why I call this project a Reality Applicatoin.

We have to be able to write an Application in Unreal Engine 5 or greater, Qt, .Net MAUI, which covers the Cross-Platform aspects of writing a one Application that can run on Linux, Android, Mac, iOS, Windows, PI and other Operations Systems, devices, and Machines, so I will show you how to do this in code, using Unreal Engine 5, Qt 6, and .Net MAUI latest.

This Application is a simple Project Manager that manages Books, and these books are in a specific format that this applicaton can handle accross multiple devices like Mobile devices, Smartphones, Tablets, as well as Laptops, Desktops, TV, and watches, I will cover all these topics in one working Applicatoion.
